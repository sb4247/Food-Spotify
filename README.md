# Food-Spotify

Requirements : A spotify account (free works)

The following code uses Spotify's authentication means to authorize the user's
spotify account.
By pressing the Request Authorization button, the user is redirected to the Spotify 
Authentication page. Upon entering the account details and granting permissions,
the user is brought back to the page with all of its features unlocked.

The Url now drastically changes. This is because it carries account code, which can 
be exchanged for tokens to make api calls. 

Below Playlist artwork, 3 playlist buttons are made availabe. 
Upon clicking either, a scrollable drop down appears.
It pulls the descriptiom, the present number of listners, and also its owner from sportify.
It then displays all the songs on that playlisy, along with its album artwork, in order of its popularity. 

Below these playlists and their contents, lies another button. Upon clicking this, 
a random food song is generated through spotify.
The song's cover picture is displayed, along with its name and owner.
Below that exists a button to play the randomly generated song. 
Upon clicking this button, the user is redirected via spotofy, to experience a 30 second trial of the song.
Upon clicking back, the user is returned to the page.
